# STA141B-Final-Project
This project is a shiny app that shows the monthly confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the World. 
In this assignment, I use the COVID-19 API:https://covid19api.com/ which allows users to access data on COVID19 through out the world.
In this shiny app, you could view any countries' monthly confirmed cases histogram by selecting the country menu. You could also find the min,max,mean, and median of the daily confirmed cases from January 2020 till now.
